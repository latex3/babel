# Hebrew

The Hebrew language is available for `pdftex`, `xetex`, and `luatex`, but the
preferred engine is the latter, because of its unique features for
bidirectional texts, not requiring explicit mark up.

There is a complete example (with a table, a footnote, maths, etc.) in the repository
([tex](https://github.com/latex3/babel/blob/main/samples/lua-hebrew.tex), 
[pdf](https://github.com/latex3/babel/blob/main/samples/lua-hebrew.pdf)).

For `pdftex` you may need to install separately the [`culmus`
package](https://www.guyrutenberg.com/culmus-latex/), which is usually
not included in TeX distributions.
