This page offers basic guidance on typesetting a LaTeX document in the
Zarma language using the Latin script.

## Support with `ini` locale file

Here is a minimal sample file with `zarma` as the main language
(assuming `luatex`, which is the recommended engine, and `babel` â‰¥24.14,
although it may work with previous versions).

```tex
\documentclass[zarma]{article}

\usepackage[provide=*]{babel}

\begin{document}

Local name $=$ Zarmaciine

Today $=$ \today

\end{document}
```
