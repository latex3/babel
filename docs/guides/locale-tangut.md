This page offers basic guidance on typesetting a LaTeX document in the
Tangut language using the Tangut script.

## Support with `ini` locale file

Here is a minimal sample file with `tangut` as the main language
(assuming `luatex`, which is the recommended engine, and `babel` â‰¥25.2,
although it may work with previous versions).

```tex
\documentclass[tangut]{article}

\usepackage[provide=*]{babel}

\babelfont{rm}{Noto Serif Tangut}

\begin{document}

Local name $=$ ð—¼‡ð—Ÿ²

\end{document}
```

You may need download the font or replace it with another one in your
system.
