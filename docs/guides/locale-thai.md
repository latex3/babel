The Thai language is available for `xetex` and `luatex`, but the
preferred engine is the latter. With `luatex`, it should work with the
default font renderer and Harfbuzz.

There is a complete example (with `microtype`) in the repository
([tex](https://github.com/latex3/babel/blob/main/samples/lua-thai.tex), 
[pdf](https://github.com/latex3/babel/blob/main/samples/lua-thai.pdf)).

## Line breaking

Rules are harcoded in XeTeX, but in LuaTeX the standard hyphenation
mechanism is used, son that you can load different rules or fine tune the
loaded ones with `\babelpatterns` (or even a transform).

With XeTeX, `babel` attempts to get rid of hyphen chars at the end of
lines, but due to the limitations of this engine it sometimes fails.
With LuaTeX there shouldnâ€™t be any problems.

Justification in both engines is controlled by a couple of options in
`\babelprovide`.

* `intraspace` sets the inner spaces in em units (so, `0 .1 0` is 0em
  plus .1em). Like `\spaceskip`, the em unit applied is that of the
  current text (more precisely, the previous glyph).
* `intrapenalty` sets the inner penalty of the breaking opportunities.
