This page offers basic guidance on typesetting a LaTeX document in the
Avestan language using the Avestan script.

## Support with `ini` locale file

Here is a minimal sample file with `avestan` as the main language
(assuming `luatex`, which is the recommended engine, and `babel` ≥25.2,
although it may work with previous versions).

```tex
\documentclass[avestan]{article}

\usepackage[provide=*,bidi=basic]{babel}

\babelfont{rm}{Noto Sans Avestan}

\begin{document}

Local name $=$ 𐬎𐬞𐬀𐬯𐬙𐬀𐬎𐬎𐬀𐬐𐬀𐬉𐬥𐬀

\end{document}
```

You may need download the font or replace it with another one in your
system.
