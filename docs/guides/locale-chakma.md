This page offers basic guidance on typesetting a LaTeX document in the
Chakma language using the Chakma script.

## Support with `ini` locale file

Here is a minimal sample file with `chakma` as the main language
(assuming `luatex`, which is the recommended engine, and `babel` â‰¥25.2,
although it may work with previous versions).

```tex
\documentclass[chakma]{article}

\usepackage[provide=*]{babel}

\babelfont{rm}{Noto Sans Chakma}

\begin{document}

Local name $=$ ð‘„Œð‘„‹ð‘„´ð‘„Ÿð‘„³ð‘„¦

Today $=$ \today

\end{document}
```

You may need download the font or replace it with another one in your
system.
