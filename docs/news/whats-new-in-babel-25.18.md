## Changes in ‘ini’ locale files

### Swiss German

There are two new locales for Swiss German, namely, `alemannic` and
`alsatian`. Remember the name `swissgerman` is temporarily assigned by
default to Swiss High German with traditional ortography
(`de-CH-1901`). See [What’s new in babel
25.17](https://latex3.github.io/babel/news/whats-new-in-babel-25.17.html).

`alemannic` is basically the same as `swissgerman` (`gsw`), and it’s a
alternative name provided by the IANA (BCP 47) registry.

Another name is `alsatian`, also in the IANA registry, but the common
tag for it is `gsw-FR`. There isn’t a standardized form of Alsatian.

### Belarusian

Added an `ini` file for taraškievica, with contributions by
[@375gnu](https://github.com/375gnu). The name is
`belarusian-taraskievica`. There are also some fixes in the standard
variant.

### Breton

Fixes contributed by
[Alan Kersaudy](https://github.com/Oktogazh).
