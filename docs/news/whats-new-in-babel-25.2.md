# What's new in babel 25.2

**draft**

I’m preparing a collection of short videos here: [LaTeX – Localization
and
multilingual](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVc2cHCI6zpJcaa1x-yK9iRjqtE3Ct2Ja).
At the moment there are five, on Arabic, Hebrew, Hindi, pure Unicode
strings and Indic languages with lazy loading.

## RTL script

The list of RTL scripts has been updated:

* AL (Arabic-like letters): Arabic, Syriac, Thaana, Hanifi Rohingya,
  Hanifi, Sogdian.

* R (Right letters): Adlam, Avestan, Chorasmian, Cypriot, Elymaic, Garay, 
  Hatran, Hebrew, Imperial Aramaic, Inscriptional Pahlavi,
  Inscriptional Parthian, Kharoshthi, Lydian, Mandaic, Manichaean,
  Mende Kikakui, Meroitic Cursive, Meroitic Hieroglyphs, Nabataean,
  Nko, Old Hungarian, Old North Arabian, Old Sogdian,
  Old South Arabian, Old Turkic, Old Uyghur, Palmyrene, Phoenician,
  Psalter Pahlavi, Samaritan, Yezidi, Mandaean,
  Meroitic, N'Ko, Orkhon, Todhri.

Note some scripts has duplicated names, because sources don’t agree.
This doesn’t hurt.

## Locales

There are a couple of new bare minimum locales:

* `algerianarabic`, with tag `arq`, also known as Darija or Lahja
   Djazairia, and different from Standard Arabic as spoken in Alger,
   with tag \texttt{ar-DZ}.
* `olduighur`(note the name is with ‘i’, because it’s the form in BCP
  47).
