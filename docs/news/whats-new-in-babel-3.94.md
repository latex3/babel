## Chinese dates

Now with the Chinese locales dates with the tradicional calendar can be
printed. By default the year is numeric, but there is a variant with
the sexagenary cycle (the latter is available only if the locale is
loaded with `provide` or `\babelprovide`).

The following two commands print the current date in the Chinese
calendar (numeric and sexagenary). See the `babel` manual for further
info:

```tex
\localedate[calendar=chinese, convert]{\year}{\month}{\day}
\localedate[calendar=chinese, variant=sexagenary, convert]{\year}{\month}{\day}
```

By default, `\today` prints the gregorian date, but this can be changed
with the option `calendar`. Remember setting it always implies the date
is converted:
```tex
\babelprovide[import, calendar=chinese]{babel}
\babelprovide[import, calendar=chinese.sexagenary]{babel}
```

With the first one, `\today` will print something like 二〇二三年七月二十, and
the second one like 癸卯年七月二十.

Note the string can be slightly diferent depending on the locale.

## New locale files

* [`javanese`](https://latex3.github.io/babel/guides/locale-javanese.html) (Latin script)
* [`nigerianpidgin`](https://latex3.github.io/babel/guides/locale-nigerianpidgin.html)
* [`maithili`](https://latex3.github.io/babel/guides/locale-maithili.html)
* [`wolof`](https://latex3.github.io/babel/guides/locale-wolof.html)

There are a few new ‘bare minimum locales’ (see [What’s new in babel 3.93](https://latex3.github.io/babel/news/whats-new-in-babel-3.93.html#new-locale-files)):

* [`akkadian`](https://latex3.github.io/babel/guides/locale-akkadian.html)
* [`balinese`](https://latex3.github.io/babel/guides/locale-balinese.html)
* [`ladino`](https://latex3.github.io/babel/guides/locale-ladino.html) (Hebrew script)
* [`lombard`](https://latex3.github.io/babel/guides/locale-lombard.html)
* [`navajo`](https://latex3.github.io/babel/guides/locale-navajo.html)
* [`oldnorse`](https://latex3.github.io/babel/guides/locale-oldnorse.html)

# Hebrew

Thanks to Udi Fogiel, `babel-hebrew` (the original style for 8-bit
engines) is again maintained, and it’s useable directly in TeXlive. The
`ini` files in the `babel` core have been adjusted to reflect correctly
the font encondings for `pdflatex`.

# New transform for kashida

Christian Lück has contributed a new transform, similar to
`kashida.plain`, but with diacritics stacked to the actual base
character and not the kashida extension. Its name is
`kashida.base`, and with evenly inserted tatweels results are
better (even much better) than with `kashida.plain`.

It’s still a set of rules for ‘plain’ Arabic font, with no ligatures.
Some fonts may require additional transforms to avoid the kashida at
specific places. See [What’s new in babel 3.59](https://latex3.github.io/babel/news/whats-new-in-babel-3.59.html)
