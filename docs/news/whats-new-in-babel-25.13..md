# What's new in babel 25.13

2025-10-01

This is a minor release with a few fixes. Most of the work is currently
internal, for the new language loader. There is also preliminary
research underway for language [tagging with
PDF/UA](https://latex3.github.io/tagging-project/) (aka Tagged PDF).
This explains why the pace of releases has slowed down.

* A few vowels were missing in a rule for the IAST Devanagari transliteration (thanks to [Peter   Pasedach](https://github.com/ppasedach)).
* Changed the string for `\proofname` in the Turkish `ini` locale file
  (thanks to [anaktonik](https://github.com/anaktonik)).
* Fixed in the manual the example for a very basic PDF tagging, which
  wasn’t complete. Now it’s described in detail [here](https://github.com/latex3/babel/discussions/357).
