# What's new in babel 24.7

2024-06-26

This is a minor release.

## Improvements in some locales

* Filipino captions, thanks to  [Leothelion, @ponte-vecchio](https://github.com/ponte-vecchio).
* Line breaking in Blin, Geez, Tigre, Tigrinya, Wolaytta. Taken from
  Amharic (see [What's new in babel
  3.44](https://latex3.github.io/babel/news/whats-new-in-babel-3.44.html)).
  
## Fixes

The new `norule` key in transforms only worked with `insert`.
