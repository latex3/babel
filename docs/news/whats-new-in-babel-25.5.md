# What's new in babel 25.4

**Draft** 

# Dutch

New transform `diaeresis.hyphen`. It removes the diaeresis above a vowel
if hyphenated just before.

# Fixes

* Some wrong bidi text in \hbox.
* Extra space with pre/postpart and pre/postchapter captions and lazy loading. 
* LaTeX hook for newly defined font families.
