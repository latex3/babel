# What's new in babel 3.43

## Autoloading based on BCP 47 codes

The most relevant new feature is the [loading on the
fly](whats-new-in-babel-3.39.md) based on BCP 47 codes. It must be
activated explicitly with `\babeladjust`, because it is meant for special tasks (most
document are mainly monolingual). Mapping from BCP 47 codes to locale
names are not hardcoded in `babel`. Instead the data is taken from the
`ini` files, which means currently about <del>250</del> 275 tags are already recognized

```tex
\documentclass{article}

\usepackage[danish]{babel}

\babeladjust{ autoload.bcp47 = on }

\begin{document}

\today

\selectlanguage{fr-CA}

\today

\end{document}
```

Babel performs a simple lookup in the following way: `fr-Latn-FR` →
`fr-Latn` → `fr-FR` → `fr`. Languages with the same resolved name are
considered the same. Case is normalized before, so that `fr-latn-fr` →
`fr-Latn-FR`. If a tag and a name overlap, the tag takes precedence (for
example, `lu` is considered `lubakatanga`). 

Currently the locales loaded are based on the `ini` files and decoupled from the main `ldf` files. This is by design, to ensure code generated externally produces the same result regardless of the languages requested in the document, but an option to use the `ldf` instead will be added in a future release, because both options make sense depending on the particular needs of each document (there will be some restrictions, however).

The behaviour is adjusted with `\babeladjust` with the following parameters:
* `autoload.bcp47` with values `on` and `off`.
* `autoload.bcp47.options`, which are passed to `\babelprovide`; empty by default, but you may add `import` (features defined in the corresponding `babel-...tex` file might not available).
* `autoload.bcp47.prefix`. Although the public name used in selectors is the tag, the internal name will be different and generated by prepending a prefix, which by default is `bcp47-`. You may change it with this key.

## Fixes

* Babel reset the `\sfcode` of `»` to 1000. Now it's the default 0.
* `\guillemotleft` and `\guillemotleft` renamed to `\guillemetleft` and `\guillemetleft` (but old names preserved for backwards compatibility) (#63).
* With autoloading the hyphenmins were set to the default values.
* With autoloading and counters an error could be raised in `pdftex`.

## Changes in `ini` locale files

* **Assamese**: Captions (#58, by Navanath Saharia)
* **Finnish**: Fixed `contents` (#61, by Teemu Likonen).
* **Marathi**: A couple of corrections (from polyglossia #409, by NiranjanTambe), and `alphabetic` counter.
* **Bangla (Bengali)**: `alphabetic` counter. 
* **Luxembourgish**: Much expanded (thanks by Sam Mersch).
* **Armenian**: Fixed counter names (see the [news for 3.42](whats-new-in-babel-3.42.md)).

## Macros in `\selectlanguage`

Since its beginnings, an alternative syntax was allowed in the argument of `\selectlanguage`, so that, say, `\selectlanguage{\dutch}` is the same as `\selectlanguage{dutch}`. Now, if the passed macro doesn't match a loaded language, it's treated as expected, that is, the string contained in the macro will be the name of the language to be selected. For example, the following piece of code will select `dutch`
```tex
\newcommand{\mylang}{dutch}
\selectlanguage{\mylang}
```

The alternative syntax is deprecated. <del>not recommended (there will be an ‘info’ about this).</del>

## Reorganization of the internal code

This change may affect a few packages.

* Some `babel` commands have been loaded with the LaTeX format for
  years, but most of them didn't work without `\usepackage{babel}` and
  raised some cryptic errors. Now in the format some of them have
  minimal definitions (`\addlanguage`, `\adddialect`, `\iflanguage`,
  `\providehyphenmins`) and others raise a more explanatory error
  (`\selectlanguage` and other selectors). The macros in the format with
  minimal definitions behave as described in the `babel` manual, but
  without some additional internal actions added by and specific to the
  `babel` package (for example, it adds code for
  `\AddBabelHook{..}{adddialect}{..}` to work). It should work without
  rebuilding the format, but it may be necessary in some cases.

* The files `switch.def` and `plain.def` will eventually disappear. Their code has been merged into `babel.def`, but they are still present as proxy files loading the relevant parts now in the latter.

* Support for TeX <3 will be removed altogether. “Support” for LaTeX 2.09 will be removed, too, basically because it hasn't worked for ages (with TeXLive 2003 already failed).
