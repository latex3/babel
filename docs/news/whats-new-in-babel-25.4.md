## More ancient languages

Adding support for ancient languages in `babel` can be beneficial for scholars,
historians, and linguists working on the preservation and study of
historical texts. There are already several locale files like
Ancient Greek, Phoenician, Akkadian, Old Uighur, Samaritan, Old Norse, Sanskrit,
Classical Mandaic, Gothic, Ancient Egyptian, Aramaic and Avestan, among
others.

Now there are some more:
* [Carian](https://latex3.github.io/babel/guides/locale-carian.html)
* [Etruscan](https://latex3.github.io/babel/guides/locale-etruscan.html)
* [Lycian](https://latex3.github.io/babel/guides/locale-lycian.html)
* [Lydian](https://latex3.github.io/babel/guides/locale-lydian.html)
* [Old Irish](https://latex3.github.io/babel/guides/locale-oldirish.html)
* [Old Persian](https://latex3.github.io/babel/guides/locale-oldpersian.html)
* [Sabaean](https://latex3.github.io/babel/guides/locale-sabaean.html)
* [Ugaritic](https://latex3.github.io/babel/guides/locale-ugaritic.html)

They all are treated as ‘bare minimum locales’, which means they define
neither captions not date. But the minimal required to use them in a
document (OpenType language system, Unicode character ranges) are
included.
