## Babel 3.89

2023-05-11

This package manages culturally-determined typographical (and other)
rules, and hyphenation patterns for a wide range of languages. Many
language styles work with pdflatex, as well as with xelatex and
lualatex out of the box. A few even work with plain formats. Included
is a set of ini files for about 250 languages.

The latest stable version is available on <https://ctan.org/pkg/babel>.

Changes in version 3.89 are described in:

https://latex3.github.io/babel/news/whats-new-in-babel-3.89.html

Apart from the manual, you can find information on some aspects of babel at:

https://latex3.github.io/babel/

The best way to install and/or update it is with the help of package
managers.
